  "readme": "# Connect [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/senchalabs/connect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/senchalabs/connect) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/connect.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/connect)\n\n  Connect is an extensible HTTP server framework for [node](http://nodejs.org) using \"plugins\" known as _middleware_.\n\n```js\nvar connect = require('connect')\n  , http = require('http');\n\nvar app = connect()\n  .use(require('compression')())\n  .use(require('cookie-session')({\n    keys: ['secret1', 'secret2']\n  }))\n  .use(require('body-parser')())\n  .use(function(req, res){\n    res.end('Hello from Connect!\\n');\n  });\n\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(3000);\n```\n\n## Connect 3.0\n\nConnect 3.0 is in progress in the `master` branch. The main changes in Connect are:\n\n- Middleware will be moved to their own repositories in the [expressjs](http://github.com/expressjs) organization\n- All node patches will be removed - all middleware _should_ work without Connect and with similar frameworks like [restify](https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify)\n- Node `0.8` is no longer supported\n- The website documentation has been removed - view the markdown readmes instead\n\nIf you would like to help maintain these middleware, please contact a [member of the expressjs team](https://github.com/orgs/expressjs/members).\n\n## Middleware\n\nThese middleware and libraries are officially supported by the Connect/Express team:\n\n  - [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) - previous `bodyParser`, `json`, and `urlencoded`. You may also be interested in:\n    - [body](https://github.com/raynos/body)\n    - [co-body](https://github.com/visionmedia/co-body)\n    - [raw-body](https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body)\n  - [compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) - previously `compress`\n  - [connect-timeout](https://github.com/expressjs/timeout) - previously `timeout`\n  - [cookie-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser) - previously `cookieParser`\n  - [cookie-session](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session) - previously `cookieSession`\n  - [csurf](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf) - previousy `csrf`\n  - [errorhandler](https://github.com/expressjs/errorhandler) - previously `error-handler`\n  - [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session) - previously `session`\n  - [method-override](https://github.com/expressjs/method-override) - previously `method-override`\n  - [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) - previously `logger`\n  - [response-time](https://github.com/expressjs/response-time) - previously `response-time`\n  - [serve-favicon](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-favicon) - previously `favicon`\n  - [serve-index](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-index) - previousy `directory`\n  - [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) - previously `static`\n  - [vhost](https://github.com/expressjs/vhost) - previously `vhost`\n\nMost of these are exact ports of their Connect 2.x equivalents. The primary exception is `cookie-session`.\n\nSome middleware previously included with Connect are no longer supported by the Connect/Express team, are replaced by an alternative module, or should be superseded by a better module. Use one of these alternatives instead:\n\n  - `cookieParser`\n    - [cookies](https://github.com/jed/cookies) and [keygrip](https://github.com/jed/keygrip)\n  - `limit`\n    - [raw-body](https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body)\n  - `multipart`\n    - [connect-multiparty](https://github.com/superjoe30/connect-multiparty)\n    - [connect-busboy](https://github.com/mscdex/connect-busboy)\n  - `query`\n    - [qs](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring)\n  - `staticCache`\n    - [st](https://github.com/isaacs/st)\n    - [connect-static](https://github.com/andrewrk/connect-static)\n\nCheckout [http-framework](https://github.com/Raynos/http-framework/wiki/Modules) for many other compatible middleware! \n\n## Running Tests\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\n https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/graphs/contributors\n\n## Node Compatibility\n\n  - Connect `< 1.x` - node `0.2`\n  - Connect `1.x` - node `0.4`\n  - Connect `< 2.8` - node `0.6`\n  - Connect `>= 2.8 < 3` - node `0.8`\n  - Connect `>= 3` - node `0.10`\n\n## License\n\nView the [LICENSE](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/blob/master/LICENSE) file.\n",
